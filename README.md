This app is a simple implementaion of the Navigation Framework
consisting of Navigation Graph, Navigation Host Fragment, 
NavController. The Navigation Graph is a xml resource cotaining details of all
the destinations(activities & fragments) and all has paths between them showing 
how we can navigate from each activity/fragment. 
NavHostFragment is like a framelayout  but here insteas we use a FragmentContainerView
a single view to show all the fragments which is to display fragments.
Each NavHostFragment has a NavController helps in navigating from one destination to other
without this we generally use intent where we need to use declartive explicit mentioning but 
with this just with help of Navigation graph containing paths helps in navigating to other destinations.
